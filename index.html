               Welcome!
            </p>
            <p>Glad to have you here! If you enjoy aviation, designing, and want to make Infinite Flight better, then you've come to the right place!</p>
            <p>Infinite Flight contains many airports worldwide, and our mission is to make sure they are as accurate as possible. We're looking for people to help with creating accurate layouts, with taxiways, taxi lines, ATC frequencies and parking spots.</p>

            <p><br><br><i>Watch this video to help you get started</i></p>
            <p>Before you can begin editing airports, a few things need to be done. Please note, you will need a PC/Mac in order to edit airports, mobile devices aren't currently supported.
            </p>
            <p>Getting started is very easy. The video above will give you a full, guided, step-by-step guide on how to prepare for editing airports. Here are the steps involved:
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>Create a <a href="http://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub account</a>, by entering your details on the GitHub website. Remember these details, they'll come in handly later!</li>
               <li>Go to the <a href="http://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports" target="blank">Airports Repository</a>, and select the 'Fork' button in the top right corner. This will make a copy of the airports under your account.</li>
               <li>Download the <a href="https://desktop.github.com" target="blank">GitHub Desktop</a> app.</li>
               <li>Install a copy of X-Plane. Skip this step if you already have a DVD/Steam copy, otherwise you can download the free demo from <a href="http://www.x-plane.com/downloads/x-plane_10_demo/" target="blank">here</a>.</li>
               <li>Install a copy of World Editor from <a href="http://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/" target="blank">here</a>.</li>
               <li>Login to the GitHub app, then tap the '+' button on the top left corner, select the 'Clone' tab, and select "InfiniteFlight-Airports". Save this to somewhere you'll remember later.</li>
               <li>Open WorldEditor, and select the folder in which you installed X-Plane to. Create a new scenery package, and call it the name of the airport you want to update.</li>
               <li>A new window should appear. Go to File - Import from apt.dat.</li>
               <li>Find the folder in which you cloned the repo to earlier. Select the airport you want to edit, and import the apt.dat.</li>
               <li>Download <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="blank">Java</a> and <a href="https://wedbing.wordpress.com/download/" target="blank">WEDBing</a>, then run WEDBing and add the path to your X-Plane folder in the top left.</li>
            </ol>
            That's all there is to it! You're good to go!

            <strong>Please check the <a href="https://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports/issues" target="blank">Issue Tracker</a> before starting your airport. Make sure it isn't already in progress, and if it isn't, please create a new issue.</strong>

            <p>Please read this section carefully, it will explain the main reasons as to why we will reject an airport submission.
               <br><br>
               <strong>DO</strong>
               <ul>
                <li>Use accurate imagery for airports</li>
                <li>Add taxiways</li>
                <li>Add taxiway lines</li>

               </ul>
               <br>
               <strong>DON'T</strong>
               <ul>
                <li>Add runway markings with taxiway lines (this includes runway numbers, blastpad arrows, etc.).</li>
                <li>Forget to include a boundary.</li>
                <li>Make up an airport - it <strong>HAS</strong> to be a real airport</li>
               </ul>
            </p>

            <p>So you've just spent some time making an airport awesome... What next?</p>
            <p>You need to send the changes you have made to us in order for them to be included in a future version of Infinite Flight! (your changes won't be instantly available for download on Infinte Flight - we tend to get the airports updated with every Infinite Flight update).</p>
            <ol>
               <li>In WorldEditor, go to File - Export as apt.dat.</li>
               <li>Save the file in the corresponding folder for the airport.</li>
               <li>Open up an email client (such as Gmail).</li>
               <li>
                  Send an email to

               </li>
               <li>Attach the apt.dat for the airport you just exported, and set the subject to the ICAO code of the airport.</li>
