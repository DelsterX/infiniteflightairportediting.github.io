<p>Glad to have you here! If you enjoy aviation, designing, and want to make Infinite Flight better, then you've come to the right place!</p>

<p>Infinite Flight contains many airports worldwide, and our mission is to make sure they are as accurate as possible. We're looking for people to help with creating accurate layouts, with taxiways, taxi lines, ATC frequencies and parking spots.</p>

<p><br><br><i>Watch this video to help you get started</i></p>
<p>Before you can begin editing airports, a few things need to be done. Please note, you will need a PC/Mac in order to edit airports, mobile devices aren't currently supported:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Create a <a href="http://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub account</a> and fork the <a href="http://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports" target="blank">repo</a>.</li>
    <li>Install a version of <a href="http://x-plane.com/" target="blank">X-Plane</a> and download <a href="http://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/" target="blank">World Editor (WED)</a>
</li>
    <li>Clone the <a href="http://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports" target="blank">repo</a>
</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
<p>Getting started is very easy. The video above will give you a full, guided, step-by-step guide on how to prepare for editing airports. Here are the steps involved:
  </p><ol>
  <li>Create a <a href="http://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub account</a>, by entering your details on the GitHub website. Remember these details, they'll come in handly later!</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports" target="blank">http://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports</a>, and select the 'Fork' button in the top right corner. This will make a copy of the airports under your account.</li>
  <li>Download the GitHub app (<a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="blank">For Mac</a>, <a href="https://windows.github.com/" target="blank">For Windows</a>).</li>
  <li>Install a copy of X-Plane. Skip this step if you already have a DVD/Steam copy, otherwise you can download the free demo from <a href="http://x-plane.com/" target="blank">x-plane.com/</a>
</li>
  <li>Install a copy of World Editor from <a href="http://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/" target="blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Login to the GitHub app, then tap the '+' button on the top left corner, select the 'Clone' tab, and select "InfiniteFlight-Airports". Save this to somewhere you'll remember later.</li>
  <li>Open WorldEditor, and select the folder in which you installed X-Plane to. Create a new scenery package, and call it the name of the airport you want to update.</li>
  <li>A new window should appear. Go to File - Import from apt.dat</li>
  <li>Find the folder in which you cloned the repo to earlier. Select the airport you want to edit, and import the apt.dat</li>
  </ol>
That's all there is to it! You're good to go!

<strong>Please check the <a href="https://github.com/carmichaelalonso/InfiniteFlight-Airports/issues" target="blank">Issue Tracker</a> before starting your airport. Make sure it isn't already in progress, and if it isn't, please create a new issue.</strong>

  <p><strong>Do's and Don'ts</strong></p>
  <p>Please read this section carefully, it will explain the main reasons as to why we will reject an airport submission.
<br><br>
<strong>DO</strong><br>
-Use accurate imagery for airports<br>
-Add taxiways<br>
-Add taxiway lines<br>
-Add parking spots<br>
-Modify runways<br>
-Add airport boundaries<br>
<br>
<strong>DON'T</strong><br>
-Add runway markings with taxiway lines (this includes runway numbers, blastpad arrows, etc.).<br>
-Forget to include a boundary.<br>
-Make up an airport - it <strong>HAS</strong> to be a real airport<br>

<a id="sending-changes" href="http://carmichaelalonso.github.io/InfiniteFlight-Airports/#authors-and-contributors"></a>Sending changes</h3>

<p>So you've just spent some time making an airport awesome... what next?</p>
<p>You need to send the changes you have made to us in order for them to be included in a future version of Infinite Flight! (your changes won't be instantly available for download on Infinte Flight - we tend to get the airports updated with every Infinite Flight update).</p>
<p>There are two ways of submitting changes:</p>
<p><strong>By email (easy)</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In WorldEditor, go to File - Export as apt.dat.</li>
  <li>Save the file in the corresponding folder for the airport.</li>
  <li>Open up an email client (such as Gmail).</li>
  <li>Send an email to <pre><code><a href="mailto:airports@liveflightapp.com">airports@liveflightapp.com</a></code></pre>
</li>
  <li>Attach the apt.dat for the airport you just exported, and set the subject to the ICAO code of the airport</li>
</ol>
<p>It should look something like this:</p>
<img src="./Infinite%20Flight%20Airport%20Editing_files/10969505_616551075157989_1300315316_o.jpg" width="100%">

<p><strong>By using GitHub (harder)</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In WorldEditor, go to File - Export as apt.dat.</li>
  <li>Save the file in the corresponding folder for the airport.</li>
  <li>Open the GitHub app you previously downloaded.</li>
  <li>It should list the airport(s) you have just edited under 'Uncommited changes'</li>
  <li>Tick the box next to the airport file, and then enter a brief 'Summary' of what you have edited.</li>
  <li>Tap commit.</li>
  <li>Once this has finished, tap "Sync" in the top-right corner.</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://github.com/" target="blank">github.com</a> and login with your username and password.</li>
  <li>Under the 'My Repositories page', you will find a repository called "InfiniteFlight-Airports" - tap on it.</li>
  <li>On the repo page, find a green button just on-top of the file list - it should be marked "Pull Request" when you hover over it.</li>
  <li>On the following page, tap "Create Pull Request"</li>
  <li>Add a summary, and tap Create Pull Request</li>
  <li>We will review the content, and merge it into the main repo!</li>
</ol>
